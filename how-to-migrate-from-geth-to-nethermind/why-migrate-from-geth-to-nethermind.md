# Why Migrate From Geth To Nethermind?

1. &#x20;**Compatibility with .NET:** Because Nethermind is written in C#, it is compatible with the .NET ecosystem. This can make it easier to integrate with other tools and systems that use .NET, such as Windows applications or Azure cloud services.
2. &#x20;**High performance and scalability:** Nethermind is known for its high performance and scalability, making it a good choice for large-scale Ethereum projects or for high-volume applications.
3. &#x20; **Light client support:** Nethermind supports light clients. Lightweight nodes that do not store the full blockchain can still access it with the same functionality and security guarantees as full nodes. This can make it easier to run Ethereum applications on resource-constrained devices, such as mobile phones or embedded devices.
4. &#x20;**Extensibility and customization:** Nethermind is designed to be extensible and customizable, making it easier to build and deploy Ethereum applications with unique requirements.

**P.S:** Nethermind is an open-source Ethereum client written in C# known for its high performance, scalability, light client support, and extensibility.&#x20;

It is compatible with the .NET ecosystem and can be a good choice for certain Ethereum projects or applications with unique requirements or that need to run on resource-constrained devices.
