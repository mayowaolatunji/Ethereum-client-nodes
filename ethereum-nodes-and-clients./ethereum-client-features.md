# Ethereum client Features

## Common Execution Client Options

### Go Ethereum&#x20;

Geth is an open-source Ethereum client written in Go. It is the most widely used Ethereum client and is maintained by the Ethereum Foundation. Geth is an execution layer client that executes transactions and maintains the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), the execution environment for smart contracts on the Ethereum network. One of the unique features of Geth is its support for the "light client" mode, which allows it to operate on limited resources and connect to the Ethereum network without needing to download the entire blockchain.

### Nethermind

Nethermind is an open-source Ethereum client written in C#. It is known for its high performance and is used by a number of decentralized applications (DApps). Like Geth, Nethermind is an execution layer client that executes transactions and maintains the EVM.

### Erigon

Erigon is an open-source Ethereum client written in Rust. It is maintained by the Parity Technologies team and is known for its high performance and scalability. Erigon is also an execution layer client that executes transactions and maintains the EVM.

### Hyperledger Besu

Hyperledger Besu is an open-source Ethereum client written in Java. It is maintained by the Hyperledger project, which is a collaborative effort to advance cross-industry blockchain technologies. Hyperledger Besu is an execution layer client that executes transactions and maintains the EVM.

### Openethereum&#x20;

Openethereum is an open-source Ethereum client written in Rust. It is maintained by the Parity Technologies team and is known for its focus on scalability and security. Like the other clients listed here, Openethereum is an execution layer client that executes transactions and maintains the EVM.

## Common Consensus Client option

### Lighthouse:

Lighthouse is an open-source Ethereum client written in Rust. It is maintained by the Sigma Prime team and is known for its focus on security and scalability. Lighthouse is a consensus layer client, which means that it is responsible for participating in the consensus process of the Ethereum network.

### Prysm&#x20;

Prysm: Prysm is an open-source Ethereum client written in Go. It is maintained by the Prysmatic Labs team and is known for its focus on scalability and security. Like Lighthouse, Prysm is a consensus layer client that participates in the consensus process of the Ethereum network, helping to ensure the security and decentralization of the network. One of the unique features of Prysm is its support for the "Casper FFG" consensus algorithm, which is designed to improve the security and scalability of the Ethereum network.

### Teku

Teku is an open-source Ethereum client written in Java. It is maintained by the ConsenSys Diligence team and is known for its focus on security and compliance. Teku is a consensus layer client that participates in the consensus process of the Ethereum network, making it an important tool for ensuring the integrity of the Ethereum network. One of the unique features of Teku is its support for "cross-client attestation," which allows nodes to verify the correctness of other nodes' blocks without needing to fully validate them.

### Lodestar

Lodestar is an open-source Ethereum client written in TypeScript. It is maintained by the ChainSafe Systems team and is known for its focus on scalability and security. Lodestar is a consensus layer client that participates in the consensus process of the Ethereum network.
